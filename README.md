You can get all my webapps which belongs to flask
Hello friends in this documentation we are going to discuss about flask .

Introduction to flask:
---------------------------
	Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more frequently than the core Flask program.
	 Flask is based on the Pocoo projects Werkzeug and Jinja2

		1. Werkzeug is a utility library for the Python programming language as we knows that the Python was a general purpose programming as it was created by Guido van Rossum.
		2. Jinja2 is template type of engine which was mainly done for python .

Pre-Requirements:
-----------------------
		The main pre-requirements were none another than python of version 3.6 or above and hardware was configured to minimum as in the market and an stable internet connection.

Installantion steps:
------------------------
		We can install flask using the command line otherwise we can do that by going with Git Bash.
		STEP-1:	Make a folder and name it as whatever you want in my case i'm going with "flaskmyproject". We can create it using either cmd-line or else with a manual process. 
		STEP-2: Now, we need to check the version of python which you installed in your machine. So, to check the version of python go with the command  "python --version" ignore double quotes.
		STEP-3: After checking the version of python if it is 3.6 or above go with the installation otherwise if the version is less than 3.6 then update to latest version. Type this in cmd-line with "py -3 -m venv venv".
		STEP-4: Now i have to activate the flask scripts do to that we do the following go to the flolder i.e., flaskmyproject in my case and open the folder which you named as and directed towards the given path --> venv\Scripts\activate and click on active.
		STEP-5: Now come to the cmd-line or Git Bash and type this to install flask  --> pip install flask.
		STEP-6: So if you want to check the version so go with this --> pip install flask so as a result we will be getting flask version in my case it is 1.1.2.
